# Welcome to Brandon’s Pandas Tutorial

The first instance of this tutorial was delivered at PyCon 2015 in
Montréal, but I hope that many other people will be able to benefit from
it over the next few years — both on occasions on which I myself get to
deliver it, and also when other instructors are able to do so.

To make it useful to as many people as possible, I hereby release it
under the MIT license (see the accompanying `LICENSE.txt` file) and I
have tried to make sure that this repository contains all of the scripts
needed to download and set up the data set that we used.  I will be
adding detailed setup instructions to this `README.md` file within the
next few days.

Remember that `git` it is not necessary to benefit from materials that
you find on GitHub — simply click the “Download ZIP” button over on the
right-hand side of the project’s front page, and all of the contents
will be delivered to you as a ZIP file instead:

For those who want to follow along with the tutorial at home, here is
the YouTube recording of the 3-hour tutorial at PyCon itself:

I hope that the recording and the exercises in this repository prove
useful if you are interested in learning more about Python and its data
analysis capabilities!
